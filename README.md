# C/C++ Programs 1st Sem (ALL LABS)

A collection of C++ programs developed during the MCA course at Kashmir University. This repository includes various algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving codes to aid students and enthusiasts in their study of C++ programming.

## Introduction

This repository contains a variety of C++ programs designed to help students grasp the fundamental and advanced concepts of C++ programming. The programs range from basic syntax and operations to complex algorithms and data structures.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang,g++).
- You have a text editor or an IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Notepad++).

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/fab-c14/MCA_Ku.git
   ```
2. Navigate to Directory
   ```
   cd MCA_Ku/cpp-programs
   ```
3. Now Run The Programs.
   ```
   g++ -o output_program_name source_file.cpp
   ```
> Note that there are some `C` Files Where you need to use `gcc` compiler and some are `c++` files where you need `g++` compiler (for windows) and i don't know about linux, here is a link [run program in linux](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-compile-and-run-a-c-c-code-in-linux/)
